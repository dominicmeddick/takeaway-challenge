As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

Right so! Instead of having a resturant I'm going to have a braai and you can order takeout from the braai. Lets make a menu:

Snacks:
Biltong : £5
Droewors : £6
Fritos : £2
Fizzer : £1

Mains:
Chops : £9
Boerewors : £7
Boerewors roll : £9
Boerewors roll c/w caramelized onions : £11
Bobotie : £8

Desert:

Milktart : £7
Koeksister : £2

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
